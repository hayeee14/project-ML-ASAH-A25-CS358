For example, if we give a model many pictures of cats and dogs, it will learn the difference and then be able to identify a new picture it had been seen before.

Thanks for helping me. So, uh, I'm a final year student at the University of Indonesia, majoring in computer science with specialization in artificial intelligence. I've always been, you know, fascinated by data, and that's what led me directly into machine learning. My core experience is in, I'd say, two main projects. My capstone project, which I just finished, was an IMAGE recognition system for identifying defective products on a production line. This was a really challenging computer vision task. We had a very small dataset, so I had to heavily use data augmentation and transfer learning. We ended up fine-tuning a pre-train ResNet 50 model and achieved about 98% accuracy. On the side, I also built a personal project, a recommendation engine for local restaurants. This was more of an NLP project. Actually, I script restaurant reviews and use topic modeling, especially LDA to extract key features and then build a content-based filtering system. My last internship was at Topee, where I worked on the Delta Engineering team. This was super valuable. I learned a lot about the real world. I built data pipelines using Airflow, wrote a lot of complex SQL queries for data extraction and helped maintain their ETL processes."

                "transcript_preview": "Thanks for looking at your projects. It clear you build a lot. Can you tell me about the single most challenging technical problem you face so far? The most challenging, yeah, I have a good one. It was definitely, definitely, definitely during my internship. We, uh, we had a machine learning model, uh, model that predicted customer turn and it worked fine in the notebook, but in the notebook, but we need to deploy it was, it was a real-time API and the, the inference speed was just terrible. It was taking, I think, three seconds to return a single prediction, which, you know, is unacceptable for a live service. My, my manager talks me with figuring out why. So first, I, I profiled the code. I took my, my, my, my pre-pre-pre-pre-processing steps where the bottleneck, I, I optimized the pandas functions, factorize everything, it got a little faster, but still not enough. The, the real issue was the model itself. It was a huge ticket learn random forest model with, I don't know, thousand of trees. So I released, I had to optimize the model itself. I researched a lot and I learned about model optimization techniques. I end up have converting the model to, to the on nnx format on nnx, the open neural network exchange. It, it basically standardize the model. Then I use the on nnx runtime for inference instead of schedule and predicts function. It was honestly a bit of gamble, but it worked. Then the, the inference time went from, from three sec, three seconds down to about 150 millisecond. It was more than 20 times faster. It was a huge win and it taught me that, that building the model is really just the first step, making it fast and deployable. That's the real challenge."

Why are you especially interested in our company Travelocca? That's actually the easiest question for me to answer. I've been following Travelocca for a while now. I'm good when only a user of your product. I use the experience feature almost every month. And as an ML student, I was always curious how it works. So I read your company's engineering blog. I read the paper your team published last year on I think it was Dynamic User State Modeling. And I was just blown away. Most companies, you know, they just use standard models. But your team is clearly building things from the ground up. You're pushing the boundaries. The blog post about your visual store infrastructure was fascinating. And that's what I want. I don't just want a job where I just call an API. I want to be in the engine room, you know. I want to be sure that by people who are smarter than me, who are solving machine scalable problems, massive scale problems, your company missions to organize information. It really resonates with me. And I truly believe my skills in data analysis and model building could actually contribute here. So yeah, that's why I'm just I'm really excited about the problems you're solving."

Yeah, so in my capstone group, a telecom university, we had a pretty major disagreement about project direction. I was in a team of four and we had to build an application. I was responsible for the back end and the database and one of my teammates was responsible for the front end. The disagreement it started when we were designing the API. I want to build a standard REST API, you know, with clear JSON endpoints, but my teammate, he had just learned Crab KL and he really want to use Crab KL, which arguments was that it was more efficient. You know, you only fetch the data you need. My argument was that none of us, especially me, knew it, knew it and we only had six weeks. It seemed like a huge unnecessary reach. So how did I handle it? So I saw how I did, so how did I handle it? We didn't just, you know, I scheduled a meeting just us two. And I just, I just, I listened, I let him talk for 15 minutes, explaining all the cool feature. And then I didn't say no. I said, okay, I see the benefits, but can you help me understand the reach, the risk? We made a list, the list, the risk list was really long. The learning curve, the complex server setup, we bought look at the list and he actually said, okay, you know what, maybe this isn't the right time for this. In the end, we used the rest API, but as compromised, I made API and points really clean. Exactly how his front end needs them and any work out. He respected that I listened and I respect his drive to learn new things. So just, yeah, just listening that was the key."

Great question. Transfer learning, right? So imagine you want to learn to play the piano, you could start from zero, learn what a key is, what a note is. It would take years to play a real song. Now imagine you're already a master at the guitar, you already understand music, you know rhythm, harmony, you don't need to learn music from scratch. You just need to learn the new part which is how do my features move on the keys. You learn piano what maybe 6 months, not 10 years. That's exactly what transfer learning is for AI. In AI, training from scratch is learning piano from zero. It takes like millions of dollars and millions of image. Transfer learning is being the bitter master. We take a master model, let's say a model called ResNet that Google or Microsoft has already trained on millions of image. That model already understands what is an edge, what is a circle, what is a texture. And then we just transfer that knowledge to our small project. For example, identifying cancer cells for research project at say the Eggman Institute, we don't need to teach the model what an edge is. We just teach it in the new part, what does a cancer cell look like. So it lets us build incredibly accurate models very fast and with very little data. It's probably the most important techniques in modern AI."
